# SDNWebApps
This app started a small one thing to keep track of the kiddo but after the wife started using it a lot more. She wanted to add more and more. We all know the time you have when you have a new born.  So, dont look down on the code to much!! lol

All the apps the family and I use.  Baby task list, Gas miles tracker, Task List and Grocery List
